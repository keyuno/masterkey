# Masterkey: Event Economy
Event assets. Digital commodities. Digital collectables. CryptoArt.


The invention of bitcoin technology is the invention of digital scarcity. Bitcoin was created to allow people to send digital information between each other in form of a token (btc). The tokens themselves are highly resistant to forgery. None of the participants can retain a valid copy of a token after the transaction has been made and there is no need to trust a centralized service to validate the transactions. All the transaction are recorded on a distributed public ledger.


The fundamental value of a distributed public ledger is the secure environment it provides that allows people to publish/send certain information without trusting any third party. Information that has been written into this ledger is automatically timestamped, anyone can view it and nobody can modify it. 

In order to record the information into the distributed public ledger a fee is paid to the those who invest resources to secure it (bitcoin miners). The "objectivity" of a distributed public ledger is measured by the amount of resources the attacker has to use in order to undermine itsâ€™ integrity.


The type of information that could be recorded on bitcoin ledger was extended using second layer protocols such as the counterparty protocol. Counterparty protocol enabled the creation of digital assets. While being network agnostic counterparty currently resides on top of bitcoin which means that all digital assets that are created via counterparty gain the security of the bitcoin network. Each transaction of counterparty assets requires a btc fee which increases the utility of bitcoin network.


Within the masterkey framework events are digital assets. The events are "objectively" timestamped by default and timestamping is used to differentiate between particular events. The first to capture the event is the owner of a particular event. It can easily be verified when a particular event was first recorded and there is no need to trust a centralized service to do so. Centralized services cannot provide "objective" timestamping simply by design, information can be edited by service operators and they are easier to attack.
